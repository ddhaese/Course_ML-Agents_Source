# ML-Agents {-}

In the course _VR Experience_ the student is being submerged in VR- and 3D game development using the Unity engine. The student will learn to work with different camera perspectives, the physics engine, audio, light and scripting. In addition, using the ML-Agents toolkit, the student will learn to enrich applications with AI. The student will be able to train agents using artificial neural networks or other ML algorithms. This repository deal only with the latter part of the course, namely the the use of ML-agents as well as a basic introduction to ML.
